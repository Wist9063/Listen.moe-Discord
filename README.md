# Official Listen.moe Discord Bot

The official discord bot that streams [Listen.moe](https://listen.moe) to your discord server. [Add it to your server here!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=222167140004790273&scope=bot&permissions=36702208)

## Usage

- After you've added the bot to your server, join a voice channel and type `~~join` to bind the bot to that channel.
- At any time, anyone can use the "Now playing" command to see what song is being played and who requested it.
- The bot's "game" will alternate between the server count and the currently playing song every 15 seconds.
